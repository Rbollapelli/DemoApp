    <h3 style="color: burlywood;">Personality:</h3>
    <p><b><i>
      The quality which makes the Mozart of Madras to be the most unique of them all is having a definite purpose in life.

      He has a passion for music which makes him to keep going with it. He never stops. The inertia of his life makes him to be very rebellious. He will never be seen saying, 'I need a break now. I am exhausted since I have composed for a big number of films this year.’ He cannot just say that. He loves music and so he can never get exhausted by composing music albums. His perseverance makes him different.
      
      Few music composers seem to have no purpose in the making of music. They just emulsify a high note, a low note, a drumroll maybe, either an EDM or an acoustic effect, a rap chorus from any local rapper and there they have it, typically catchy yet hopeless music. Again, I am not saying all the composers, but many of them.
      
      Rahman Sir, on the other hand, believes in the idea of music liberating one's soul. Some of his songs were purely based on his instincts. This instinctively rebellious nature of the Isai Puyal makes him stand out and make a difference. For example, in the movie Lagaan, the song Ghanan Ghanan was an outcome of the wonderful thoughts going on his mind the other night while he was desperately trying to find a perfect description for first rains in a drought region. And then suddenly, he woke up the director of the film in the middle of the night and said, “I got it.” And that's how he came up with the word 'Ghanan'.
      
      Rahman always tries to experiment with his music. He experiments with a variety of chords, a Bible of musical notes, a set of different instruments and then puts them together to create a MASTERPIECE. This experimental quality makes him stand out.
      
      He never brags about his music. Sometimes, I just feel that he is too humble, modest and innocent for this world. But again, this appealing quality of his impresses me. Above all, he's quite smart.
      
      He is also very magnanimous when it comes to money. He never hesitates to give away all that he has to help the needy. Apart from a musician, he's also a philanthropist.
