        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of the most dynamic captain on the field , a personality I truly adore. Dhoni is known as one of the best ODI captain the game of cricket has seen and will forever be for a very long time. Some of his decisions on the field will make you scratch your head. People think he is a person who always follow his instincts, makes decision by his gut feelings and what not but in my opinion he is the better observer of the game.
